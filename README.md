# DISMv2
Discretization Independent Surrogate Modeling, v2

IN-PROGRESS: model implementations are available, example training code with dataset and python environment information in progress.


Introduction
------------
This repository provides supporting code for the manuscript: "Discretization-independent surrogate modeling of physical fields around variable geometries using coordinate-based networks," which is currently under submission and not yet publicly available. 

Tensorflow implementations for the compared methods are provided, including:

1. DV-MLP: Design variable multi-layer perceptron.
2. DV-MLP FF: Design-variable multi-layer-peceptron with Fourier features.
3. DVH: Design variable hypernetwork.
4. DVH-FF: Design variable hypernetworks with Fourier features.

The vehicle aerodynamics dataset from the paper is proprietary and not provided. An alternate Poisson-problem dataset will be provided, but is not yet available.
